# Student

• Developed a cross-platform mobile application using Xamarin to manage the various activities of 
 university students and communicate between them and the university administration in “Real Time” 
 using SignalR.
 
• Connected this mobile application with a Dirassa platform (developed by ITComp using an old framework 
 ASP.NET MVC) and implemented a new version of it with some architectural changes, using the new 
 framework ASP.NET Core and SQL Server.
